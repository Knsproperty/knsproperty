    review:
      "We recently sold our upscale villa in Dubai through K&S Properties. Mr. Samer Jammal, the Managing Director, accompanied us through the entire process. This included market research and insights into what’s realistic vs what’s not, very transparent advisory, management of the entire process of depicting the property in the best way possible and posting it on relevant media. It also included him actively hunting for solvent buyers from his own (great) network of potential clients. In the end, he also vetted all buyer candidates and filtered out those that did not make sense for us and would have resulted in a lot of wasted time. The process was immaculate. We always felt in good hands and were happy overall not only once the villa was sold, but also for the period after, i.e. until the actual handover happened. Absolutely recommended and super professional property consultant!",

      "I would like to once more thank you for the excellent service I have received from you in the successful sale of my property. I have interacted over the years with many real estate agents in numerous countries, but I have rarely encountered someone as professional as you. You have guided me each step of the way, provided unbiased advice (even when such advice was against your personal interests as an agent at times) and handled the whole process calmly and flawlessly.If I had to choose two words to define you, I would choose “Professionalism” and “Integrity”, two qualities rarely found your competitors. You can be certain that I will only deal with you for any future real estate transaction in the UAE. You have my entire trust. Thank you again",

    review:"Due to the uniqueness of the Dubai Real Estate market, finding a property there can be a rather daunting task. All along the process, Samer was very professional and patient, responding quickly to all the queries I had. He asked me from the beginning the right questions that made me confident that he was the right guide for my search. His deep knowledge of the market and his relationships with the developers helped me to make quick decision without second thoughts. I highly recommend Samer!"

    review:"When my wife and I decided to finally buy a house in Dubai to live in with our family of 4, we never imagined it would be so difficult… so many choices of communities, types, layouts, locations… we were lucky to meet Samer who quickly turned this search into an exciting adventure and helped us find our home! Always ready, willing and able to help, honest above all, and made sure the whole process was a breeze! Being a first time buyer, we benefited a lot from his experience and advice not only on the house itself but on navigating all the admin and headaches. Thanks a lot!!"
